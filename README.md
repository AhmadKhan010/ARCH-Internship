# Machine Learning Internship Tasks

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the ARCH Technologies Machine Learning Internship (Category B). This repository contains implementations of two tasks based on Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron. Each task is organized in its own folder, focusing on distinct machine learning concepts: classification (Task 01: MNIST Digit Classifier) and regression/classification deep dive (Task 02: Regression and Classification). The repository includes Jupyter notebooks, trained models, Gradio web apps for interactive predictions, visualizations, and comprehensive documentation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates proficiency in machine learning model development, evaluation, and deployment, as required by the ARCH Technologies internship. The tasks are:

### Task 01: MNIST Digit Classifier

- Implements digit classification using the MNIST dataset.
- Includes models like Random Forest and SGD Classifier.
- Features a Gradio app for drawing and classifying digits.
- Based on Chapter 3 of Hands-On Machine Learning.

### Task 02: Regression and Classification Deep Dive

- Explores regression (synthetic quadratic data) and classification (Iris dataset).
- Implements Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Logistic Regression, and Softmax Regression.
- Includes custom Batch Gradient Descent for Softmax Regression (Chapter 4, Exercise 12).
- Features a Gradio app for regression and Iris species prediction.
Based on Chapter 4 of Hands-On Machine Learning.
